 CRYPTO ANALYZE PLATFORM
A → Z FULL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & LOGIC
A️⃣ PROBLEM STATEMENT (WHY THIS SYSTEM EXISTS)
Most crypto tools fail because they:

Show past performance, not future probability

Use black‑box signals

Never learn from mistakes

Don’t prove accuracy transparently

Your system solves this by:
✔ Predicting future probability, not certainty
✔ Ranking best opportunities, not noise
✔ Tracking real outcomes
✔ Auto‑learning from Telegram + market results

C️⃣ DATA SOURCES (WHAT DATA YOU USE)
1. Market Price Data
Source:

Binance / Bybit / OKX API

Data:

OHLCV candles (1H / 4H / 1D)

Volume

Latest price

Used for:

Charting

Fib detection

LSTM training

Outcome evaluation

2. Internal Prediction Memory (CRITICAL)
Stored in your DB:

Every prediction

Every ranking

Every Telegram post

Every outcome

This is your edge dataset.

D️⃣ RULE ENGINE (FOUNDATION LOGIC)
This is human trading logic encoded.

Core Rules:
Market structure (HH/HL or LH/LL)

Fibonacci retracement zones

RSI conditions

EMA distance

Session bias

Liquidity confirmation

Output:
RuleScore (0–100)
This ensures:

No random trades

No ML hallucination

Context awareness

E️⃣ FIBONACCI PROBABILITY LOGIC
Key Fib zones:

50%

61.8%

70.5%

78.6%

Scoring Example:
Price at 61.8% + bullish structure + RSI > 50
→ High probability reaction
Fib is not used alone — it is contextualized.

F️⃣ FEATURE ENGINEERING (FOR ML)
Each prediction is converted into structured features:

Feature	Reason
RuleScore	Human logic
ExpectedMovePct	Risk/reward
Direction	Long / Short
RSI	Momentum
EMA distance	Trend strength
Fib level	Mean reversion
Volatility	Risk
Volume	Liquidity
Coin accuracy	Memory
Timeframe accuracy	Context
These features are explainable.

G️⃣ ML MODEL (XGBOOST – CORE INTELLIGENCE)
ML Goal:
Predict probability that TP is hit before SL

This is binary classification, not guessing price.

Labels:
SUCCESS → 1

FAIL → 0

PARTIAL → optional weight

Why XGBoost:

Handles tabular data best

Stable

Fast retraining

Interpretable

H️⃣ LSTM MODEL (DIRECTION & PATH)
LSTM is used for:

Directional bias

Expected move magnitude

Future path visualization

Not used alone.

Output:
lstm_path = [p1, p2, p3...]
direction = UP / DOWN
expected_move_pct
Shown visually, not trusted blindly.

I️⃣ FINAL CONFIDENCE FORMULA
This is the brain of the system:

FinalConfidence =
0.40 × RuleScore
+ 0.35 × ML_Probability
+ 0.25 × LSTM_Confidence
Why:

Rules = stability

ML = learning

LSTM = forward bias

J️⃣ PREDICTION OUTPUT (SINGLE COIN)
For any coinpair + timeframe:

{
  "direction": "UP",
  "confidence": 82,
  "expected_move_pct": 3.2,
  "entry_price": 98.4,
  "target_price": 101.6,
  "expires_at": "4H later"
}
This is decision‑ready, not hype.

K️⃣ RANKING ENGINE (TOP‑10 GAINERS / LOSERS)
Why ranking matters:
Traders don’t want one signal — they want best opportunities.

Rank Score Formula:
RankScore =
|ExpectedMove|
× FinalConfidence
× HistoricalAccuracy
× LiquidityWeight
This removes:

Illiquid coins

Random spikes

Overfitted assets

L️⃣ TIMEFRAMES SUPPORTED
1H → scalpers

4H → swing traders

1D → position traders

Each has:

Separate accuracy

Separate ML behavior

Separate ranking

M️⃣ TELEGRAM INTEGRATION
Telegram is not marketing — it is part of the system.

What is posted:
Top‑10 Gainers

Top‑10 Losers

Confidence

Accuracy

Targets

Each post is:

Stored

Evaluated later

Fed back into ML

N️⃣ PREDICTION DATABASE (MEMORY)
Tables:
predictions

ranking_snapshots

Stored fields:

Coin

Timeframe

Entry / target

O️⃣ OUTCOME EVALUATION LOGIC
After timeframe expires:

Fetch latest price

Compare vs target & stop

Mark:

SUCCESS

FAIL

PARTIAL

No manual bias. Fully automatic.
